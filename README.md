============
Quick post to act as portfolio piece. Just the strict source is included, all done in C# and XAML.

Everything in /XAML is xml defining my views and a bit of their characteristics,
Everything in /Model are various objects to hold downloaded data, note anything ending in a C (TimesC.cs) is a collection
All the rest in the root is control stuff for the corresponding screen/model

Please send any and all inquiries to nward24@uwo.ca
